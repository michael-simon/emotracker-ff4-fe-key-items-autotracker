# emotracker-ff4-fe-key-items-autotracker

To use this in EmoTracker, you must first follow the instructions to set up autotrackers in general for SNES games, which are on the EmoTracker discord. 

Once you have all that set up, place the .zip file from the 'Releases' section of this github into the 'packs' directory, and unzip it there (for some reason, Github creates a nested folder in its release zips.)

That should be all it takes! Once you select this pack, the robot on the lower right corner of the display should be clickable and you should be able to proceed from there.
